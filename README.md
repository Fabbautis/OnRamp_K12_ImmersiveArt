## Building for Testing

This product is a mobile app designed specifically for iPad. When you build to a device, you will need to ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode and an apple device. If you need a iPad for testing, please check one out with Jeanne. 

Keep in mind, you can test on Unity using the emulator, but you should have builds to iPad for in person testing in the luminary.

Requirements
- For IOS you will need a MAC with XCode installed. You will Also need
a Free Apple Developer License which you can easily get by
